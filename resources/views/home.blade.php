<p style="color: white;">No other school offers Spanish immersion like Pueblo! It is the only Spanish immersion program in the Scottsdale Unified School District. Students learn half of their subjects daily in English, and the other half in Spanish. They are introduced to Spanish grammar & syntax. They are exposed to cultural traditions and celebrations from across the world in Spanish-speaking countries.
<br>

The Pueblo PTO supplements our childrens' education by providing additional enrichment activities such as the Art Masterpiece program, and Spanish resources that are only at our school, Pueblo.
<br>
Pueblo PTO is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization – your donation is 100% tax deductible. Please drop off cash or check payable to: Pueblo PTO at Pueblo Front Office.
<br>
Schedules are busy for everyone…but being involved in our children’s education is important. Don’t be afraid to sign up to be a volunteer, there are lots of fundraisers and school events throughout the year. The more people we have, the better our community will be which will only benefit OUR children.
