<p style="color: white;">No other school offers Spanish immersion like Pueblo! It is the only Spanish immersion program in the Scottsdale Unified School District. Students learn half of their subjects daily in English, and the other half in Spanish. They are introduced to Spanish grammar & syntax. They are exposed to cultural traditions and celebrations from across the world in Spanish-speaking countries.
<br>

The Pueblo PTO supplements our childrens' education by providing additional enrichment activities such as the Art Masterpiece program, and Spanish resources that are only at our school, Pueblo.
<br>
