$('#search').keyup(function() {
	var search = $('#search').val();

	$.ajax({
		url:'search.php',
		data: {search: search},
		type: 'post',
		success: function(data) {
			if(!data.error) {
			$('#result').html(data);
			}
		});
	});
});

This example I am going to use for my search field for my project. jQuery will find the element with #id as search. On keyup, a function is performed below for the example of a user doing a car search. A variable is created that will hold the value of what is entered and will submit it to search.php in laravel to perform some code on that value and output it to the viewport.

The .val() is the value from the user.

Then the query on search.php will be:

$search=$_POST['search'];

if(!empty($search)) {
	
	$query = "SELECT * FROM cars WHERE cars LIKE '$search%'";
	$search_query = mysql_query($connection, $query);

}

return "the match from db";
